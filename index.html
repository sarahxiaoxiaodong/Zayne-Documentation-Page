          <li>He really dislikes carrots!</li>
          <li>When he's down with a cold, he dodges the medicine and insists on a hot cocoa instead.</li>
          <li>Zayne's alcohol limit: One piece of liqueur chocolate.</li>
          <li>Though strict towards others, he easily indulges in his own cravings</li>

        <header>Myth</header>
        <p>In Zayne's Myth Tower of Secrets, he is known as the Foreseer</p>
        <p>The Foreseer meets the alternate version of the Player when she pretends to be a royal envoy, </p>
        <p>in order to steal the Creatio Protocore from the Foreseer's scepter to keep herself from dying</p>
        <p>Foreseer makes a deal with the alternate version of the Player: if she can make the jasmine growing on the Tower of Thorns bloom, she can leave the Tower of Thorns alive.</p>
        <p>Zayne eventually falls in love with her during this period and imbues her with Astras power through the Creatio Protocore,</p>
